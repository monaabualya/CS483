Project Overview:
Thoughtstream is a RESTful API that allows users to create, manage, and reflect on their daily thoughts through diary entries.
The API provides endpoints for CRUD operations and allows filtering entries by title, content tags, and location.
I accomplished Part 1/3 of this project which is setting up the backend.

Setup instructions:
First, "npm run dev" is run on terminal in diary-app direction to activate node.js. 
Next, mongoDB is opened on a page for easy viewing on results with
Lastly, postman is opened and a sample entry is written in the body to test all possible cases

API Usage Guide:
POST:
    endpoint: /api/diary
    description: create a new diary entry
GET:
    endpoint: /api/diary
    description: get all diary entries
GET:
    endpoint: /api/diary/:id
    description: get a single entry by ID
PUT:
    endpoint: /api/diary/:id
    description: update an existing entry
DELETE:
    endpoint: /api/diary/:id
    description: delete an entry by ID

Environment Variables:
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<db_password>diarycluster.vpiitjf.mongodb.net/diarydb?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=diaryCluster
    PORT: 5000

Common Issues and Debugging tips:
    - ensure MONGO_URI is correct
    - check endpoints and all parts of the method
    - verify that the id you  are passing exists
